This little sample shows a way to combine <strong>bootstrap</strong> from Twitter (Javascript-page) with the new Dart-Language.

For now it's more a "proof of concept" than something usefull.

Click [[here]](http://www.mikemitterer.at/fileadmin/sourcesamples/dartbootstrap-sample/javascript.html) to try the working sample...

If you ask yourself what the f*** is Dart - then click [[dartlang]](http://www.dartlang.org/) for 
more informations about this great new language from Google.

Right now (03 23 1212) this sample throws an error (<strong>Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'apply' of undefined</strong>)
in Chrome or Firefox but works in Chromium. 
You can see the bug if you click on the "Launch demo modal" button. - Nothing happens, instead the error is thrown.

Bug is already filed at [issue-tracker](http://code.google.com/p/dart/issues/detail?id=2265&q=Uncaught%20TypeError%3A%20Cannot%20call%20method%20'apply'%20of%20undefined&colspec=ID%20Type%20Status%20Priority%20Area%20Owner%20Summary)
